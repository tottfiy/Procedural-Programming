# Matrix Rotation Program

This is a simple C program that generates a 4x4 matrix filled with random numbers, prints it, rotates the matrix in place (by transposing it), and prints the rotated matrix.


## Requirements

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- A C compiler that supports the standard C libraries.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source file.
3. Compile the program using `gcc`:

   ```bash
   gcc -o matrix matrix.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./matrix
   ```


# Substring Finder Program

This program searches for a substring within a given string and returns the index of its first occurrence.
## Requirements

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.

## Compilation

To compile the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `substring.c`. Then run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o substring substring.c
```

This command compiles `substring.c` and generates an executable named `substring`.

## Running the Program

After compilation, you can run the program with the following command:

```bash
./substring
```
